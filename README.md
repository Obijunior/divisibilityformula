# divisibilityformula

If you multiply a number by a number, what do you divide that third number by to make it so that the second number was all 0s except for the first digit?

X * ABC = X(ABC)

X(ABC) / 1.(BC/A) = X(A00)

x * y = z

z / n = q

Basically the program finds out what n equals.

IMPORTANT - Don't multiply a, b, c, etc., to each other. They're just there to signify different digits.
